### NCEAS EDS Summit 2024 Working Group: End-User Oriented Scientific Practice

### 10 Simple Rules for Data Communication:
1) Identify and engage with the target audience / end-user early on to understand their needs. And how the data will be used
- Co-design (here or maybe the next rule)
- And KNOW your audience!
2) Iterate design by seeking feedback throughout the data curation and visualization process
- Allow room for asking questions
- Picking the best visualization may require comparing alternatives and fine-tuning
3) Keep it simple - Identify and highlight the key points that you are trying to convey
- Free of jargon, 1-2 key points
- The visualization takes into account the nature of human cognitive processing and limitations
4) Provide context and narrative to ensure relevance to the end-users.
- Data gains semantic value from context
5) Follow design principles for visualization and UX to ensure accessibility to diverse audiences.
- Meets Tufte's rules (maximum message, minimum space and ink)
- And other visualization best practices
6) Convey uncertainty in the data
- Can use animation 
- Annotation
7) Present data and output transparently.
- Metadata
- Also need to be mindful of data literacy of the audience
- Include disclosure of limitations here?
- Open source
8) Ethical storytelling: consider the impact of how you communicate your results
- Find an example of unintentional creation of a different narrative
- Think ahead and avoid harm
9) Ensure that your communication tools/products reach the target audience(s)
- Social media, finding people where they are
- Will happen more easily if earlier rules are also followed
- Strategize
10) Measure the success of your communication strategy
- Analytics (interactions, time spent on page/app, etc), response rate of feedback survey, attendance
- Retrospective meetings, discuss team successes/pressure points 

**Idea/Challenge** Audience/end-users need data/products that are *relevant* & *transparent*.

**Product/Goal**

-   Best practices for:

-   requirements gathering/ community engagement & team creation (*co-design*)

-   iterative collection, curation, analysis, visualization, other deliverables (*co-development*)

-   sharing results

-   uncertainty, UX design, format of delivery (*co-production*)

**Approach**

-   involve environmental data scientists, social scientist, science communication experts, domain experts

-   review existing resources/literature

-   blog/survey with call for participation -\> collectively developed resource

-   coordinator leader

-   slack/meetings/email
